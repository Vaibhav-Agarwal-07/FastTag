# FASTag Recharge - Demo (React + Tailwind + PWA)

This is a small demo React project styled with Tailwind (v3.3.2) and a minimal PWA service worker.

How to run:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` (Create React App environment assumed)

Notes:
- Login and wallet are stored in localStorage.
- The service worker is a minimal example for caching static files.
- Replace service worker with Workbox or CRA's default for production.
